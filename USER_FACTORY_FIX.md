# User Factory Improvement

This document summarizes the improvements made to the `UserFactory` to enhance the quality and security of the generated user data.

## Summary of Changes

1.  **Password Hashing**:
    *   The `UserFactory` now hashes passwords using `Hash::make()` before storing them, which is a crucial security improvement.

2.  **Added Missing Fields**:
    *   The factory now generates values for all the fields in the `users` table, including `no_telp`, `jenis_kelamin`, `program_studi`, `angkatan`, `alamat`, and `level`. This ensures that the generated user data is complete and more realistic.

3.  **Nullable `email_verified_at`**:
    *   The `email_verified_at` field is now nullable by default, which provides more flexibility when creating user records.

These changes improve the quality, completeness, and security of the user data generated by the factory, which is beneficial for testing and seeding the database.
